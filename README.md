# Exercise App (MERN)

A simple weekend project learning the MERN stack. Uses MongoDB as the database

## Theme

Exercise app where the user can put in exercises and keep track of their fitness

# To Do

Lots! Need to make it more functional and complete. Add style to it. But currently completing studies and will complete afterwards.

# Reason why creating it

To learn the MERN stack before I started learning React and Rails. I hope to do this MERN exercise into something else other than a fitness tracker.
